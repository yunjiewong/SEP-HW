<h2 align='center'> SQL Evaluation Prep </h2>

#### 1.What is index; types of indices; pros and cons
    - simply put,index is a pointer to data, to find data in a table without scanning the entire table
    - types: clustered and nonclustered indexes
    - pros: easy retrieval of data
    - cons: additional disk space, make insert, update, delete slower
    
#### 2. What's the difference between Primary key and Unique constraint?
    - PK is unique and not null by default, and there is only one PK in a table
    - Unique: constraint the data to be unique, can be many unique constraints in a table
    
#### 3. Tell me about check constraint
    - check domain integrity
#### 4.Difference between temp table and table variable
    - Life scope: 
      - temp table can be local or global
      - table variable is valid in a batch
#### 5. Difference between WHERE and HAVING
    - where: 
    - Having: aggregate function

 #### 6. Difference between RANK() and DenseRank() â€” value gap
    - rank() doesn't catch up with row numbers
    
 #### 7. COUNT(*) vs. COUNT(colName)
    - COUNT(*): count all rows in a table including NULL values
    - count(colName): count all rows in a column excluding the NULL value
    
 #### 8.What's the difference between left join and inner join? JOIN and Subquery, which one has a better performance, why?
    - inner join only returns rows that have matching value in both table
    - Left join: returns all rows in a left table
    - subquery has a better performance
 #### 9. What is correlated subquery
     - inner query is dependent on outer query
 #### 10.What is a CTE, why do we need CTE?
    - CTE: common table expression
    - readability
  
 #### 11. What does SQL Profiler do?
    - an interface to create and manage traces and analyze and replay trace results
 #### 12. What is SQL injection, how to avoid SQL injection?
    - SQL injection: ask users to insert values
    - avoid injection: use string 
    
 #### 13.Difference between SP and user defined function? When to use SP when to use function?
 
 #### 14. Criteria of Union and Union all? Difference between UNION and UNION ALL
    - Criteria: must have same column number and data type related to that column
    - difference: union all have duplicate rows, union deletes duplicates
 #### 15. Steps you take to improve SQL Queries

  
 #### 16.concurrency problem in transaction
 
 #### 17.what is deadlock, how to prevent
 
 #### 18. what is normalization, 1NF - BCNF, benefits using normalization
    - normalization: a process of organizing data to minimize redundancy
    - pros: data consistency, save disk space
    - 1NF: all atomic values
    - 2NF: no partial dependency
    - 3NF: no transitive dependency
    - BCNF: stricter version of 3NF

    
 #### 19.what are the system defined databases?
    - master, tempdb, model, msdb
 #### 20.composite key
    - combine two or more columns used to uniquely identify each row in a table
  
 #### 21. candidate key
    - unique can be used as candidate key
 #### 22.DDL vs. DML
    - DDL: data defination Language
    - DML: data manipulation language
    
 #### 23.ACID property
    - Atomicity: the entire transaction happens at once or never happens at all
    - Consistency: the database must be consistent before and after the transaction
    - Isolation: multiple transaction occurs independently without interference
    - Durability: the changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs
 #### 24. table scan vs. index scan
    - table scan: search for condition-satisfied data according to insertion order
    - index scan: search for condition-satisfied data according to index page order  ....
 #### 25.Difference between Union and JOIN
    - Union: combine data vertically (new rows)
    - Join: combine data horizontally (new columns)
