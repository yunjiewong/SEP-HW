1. reference type: store reference to the data 
    value type: store actual data
2. boxing: convert value type to refenrence type ; unboxing: convert reference type to value type
3. abstract vs. interface: a contract of class only declaration not implementation, multiple inheritance
4. overloding vs. overriding
5. constructor: speacial method with the same class name, no return type, used to assign initial values
    can be overloding, not overriding
6.  static: when member is declared static, it can be accessed with the name with its class directly. store at class level
7.  virtual method vs. abstract method: virtual has implementation, subclass can override virtual method. 
8. The delegate is a reference type data type that defines the method signature
 a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type
     built-in delegates: action return nothing, func return any type, predicate return boolean
9. access modifier: public, private, protected
10. extension method: add methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type
11. ref , out, params: ref pass by reference, parameters may be modified, out: must be motified, params: takes various number of parameters

12. pass by reference: ref,out,in  pass by value
13. array: fixed length  arraylist: unfixed length
14. encapsulation: wrapping code and data together
15. handle exception: try- catch- finally
16. generic: <T>  constraint
