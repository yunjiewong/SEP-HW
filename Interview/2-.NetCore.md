  - Routing: Define and constrain request routes
  - Session: Provides support for managing user sessions

#### 11. What is your understanding of Caching? How did you use Caching in your application? In-memory or Distributed caching? Give me some examples where caching is useful.
#### 12. Do you know what is model binding in asp.net core, how is it useful for developers?
#### 13. Explain what Routing is along with attribute Routing
