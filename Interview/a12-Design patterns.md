#### Architecture and Design patterns
#### 1. What is dependency injection. Advantages and Disadvantages. Your use of dependency in your project. What IOC did you use in your project?


#### 2. Explain SOLID principles.
single responsibility principle: each class has only one job to do
open closed principle: 
liskov substitution principle: derived class is substitutable by its base class
interface segregation principle: 
dependency inversion principle

#### 3. Explain the whole architecture of your project including your technologies you have used. (n-layer, Onion, CQRS)


#### 4. Explain microservices architecture? How is it different from Monolithic Architecture?

#### 5. What are the advantages of microservices?
easy to unit test, flexible, scalibility 

#### 6. What are the challenges faced while using Microservices?

#### 7. How can independent micro-services communicate with each other?
rest Api

#### 8. What is the use of Docker? How does it help in microservices?
Using Docker, it is easy to create required services separately without affecting other services
make your application independent of the host environment.


#### 9. Please explain OOP concepts with examples from your project.
encapsulation
inheritence
polymorphism
abstraction

#### 10. Explain the design patterns you have used in your project

creational design patterns: class instantiation
structutal design pattern: class and object composition (inheritance to compose interfaces)
behaviral design pattern: class's object communication

  - Dependency Injection
  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Repository
  - Abstract Factory
  - Adapter
  - Strategy<hr>


#### async and multithreading

#### CI/CD pipeline

#### Unit test vs. end to end testing
Unit test is to make sure the fundamental building blocks are working well.
e2e is to stimulate a user's interaction with the application
